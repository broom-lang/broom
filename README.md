# Broom

Effective, modular, functional programming language. WIP.

## Main Features

Currently can't run any useful programs, but this is what it will be like:

* ML dialect
    - Syntax should be more wieldy and mainstream
    - No let-generalization
* ML-style module system
    - Both 'generative' (SML) and 'applicative' (OCaml) functors
* Remove ML limitations around recursion
    - Recursive modules
* First-class modules à la 1ML
    - Also subsumes e.g. higher-ranked types
* (Modular) implicits for ad-hoc polymorphism
* Row-typed records (and modules, since they are the same)
* Row-based effect system à la Koka
